[00:10.79] I dunno what I was thinking
[00:12.89] Leaving my child behind
[00:15.19] Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind
[00:35.69] 
[00:19.82] With all this anger, guilt and sadness
[00:23.03] Coming to haunt me forever
[00:25.18] I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river
[00:50.18] 
[00:30.85] Is this revenge I am seeking
[00:32.94] Or seeking someone to avenge me
[00:35.10] Stuck in my own paradox I wanna set myself free
[00:58.60] 
[00:40.40] Maybe I should chase and find
[00:43.02] Before they'll try to stop it
[00:45.68] It won't be long before I'll become a puppet
[01:07.68] 
[00:50.35] It's been so long
[00:52.72] Since I last have seen my son
[00:55.31] Lost to this monster
[00:56.92] To the man behind the slaughter
[01:12.42] 
[01:00.89] Since you've been gone
[01:02.97] I've been singing this stupid song
[01:05.35] So I could ponder
[01:07.05] The sanity of your mother
[01:19.55] 
[01:32.01] I wish I lived in the present
[01:33.95] With the gift of my past mistakes
[01:36.20] But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
[02:02.20] 
[01:41.58] Your sweet little eyes, your little smile
[01:44.96] Is all I remember
[01:46.58] Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper
[02:06.58] 
[01:52.04] Justification is killing me
[01:54.38] But killing isn't justified
[01:56.72] What happened to my son, I'm terrified
[02:15.72] 
[02:02.25] It lingers in my mind and the thought keeps on getting bigger
[02:06.96] I'm sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there
[02:30.46] 
[02:12.41] It's been so long
[02:14.55] Since I last have seen my son
[02:16.65] Lost to this monster
[02:18.23] To the man behind the slaughter
[02:33.73] 
[02:22.48] Since you've been gone
[02:24.75] I've been singing this stupid song
[02:26.89] So I could ponder
[02:28.72] The sanity of your mother
