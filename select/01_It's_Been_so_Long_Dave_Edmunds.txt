Tell me baby what 's been on your mind
Come on baby don't be so unkind

Cause it's been (it's been)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
It's been so long since you've gone

Worried baby, worried of you,
Worried baby, by the things you do

Cause it's been (it's been)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
It's been so long since you've gone

We'll found out, another day around
It's getting better, It's getting worst,
It's just another sound

Love you baby, love you all the time,
Can't you see I've got you on my mind

Cause it's been (it's been)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
It's been so long since you've gone

Love you baby, love you baby true,
Think of me, Cause I'm here thinking of you

Cause it's been (it's been)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)
It's been so long since you've gone

Well it's been (it's been)
So long (so long)
So long (so long)

It's been so long since you've gone

It's been so long since you've gone

It's been so long since you've gone.
