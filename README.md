[00:10.24] I don't know what I was thinking
[00:11.33] Leaving my child behind
[00:13.57] Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind
[00:18.72] With all this anger, guilt and sadness
[00:21.35] Coming to haunt me forever
[00:24.08] I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river
[00:49.08] 
[00:29.34] Is this revenge I am seeking?
[00:31.69] Or seeking someone to avenge me?
[00:33.95] Stuck in my own paradox, I wanna set myself free
[00:38.76] Maybe I should chase and find
[00:41.42] Before they'll try to stop it
[00:43.69] It won't be long before I'll become a puppet
[01:05.69] 
[00:49.08] It's been so long
[00:51.39] Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster
[00:55.01] To the man behind the slaughter
[00:59.01] Since you've been gone
[01:00.72] I've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder
[01:05.09] The sanity of your mother
[01:17.59] 
[01:29.07] I wish I lived in the present
[01:31.03] With the gift of my past mistakes
[01:34.13] But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
[01:38.76] Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember
[01:43.70] Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper
[02:03.70] 
[01:48.81] Justification is killing me
[01:51.14] But killing isn't justified
[01:53.80] What happened to my son? I'm terrified
[01:58.54] It lingers in my mind
[02:00.83] And the thought keeps on getting bigger
[02:03.88] I'm sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there
[02:27.38] 
[02:08.81] It's been so long
[02:11.53] Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster
[02:14.82] To the man behind the slaughter
[02:19.14] Since you've been gone
[02:20.81] I've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder
[02:25.04] The sanity of your mother
